# BudgetBuddy
A JavaScript App to help people with budgeting during the cost of living crisis. Part of the Code First Girls JavaScript MOOC challenge.

From the brief I decided to build a budget app to showcase what I have learnt from the MOOC and a tool that I would use to help myself budget during this crisis.
I have built an app where you can record your income, expenses and track how much money you have left at the end of the month.
The features include different tabs for the income, expense, summary and some useful resources to help get advice on budgeting. 
You can also amend entries, delete incorrect entries and add new entries.
There is also a summary graph visually indicating how much money has come in and gone out.



# Technology used
HTML5, CSS3. JavaScript, GitHub

# Troubleshooting
Struggled to get the entry list to display realised I needed to convert to a JSON string.

Used JSON.stringify() - JavaScript | MDN (mozilla.org) to find resolution.

# Future Improvement

For a Version 2 of this application, I would love to add extra functionality to add templates.

For example with  pre-existing fields for different types of people like students, parents, homeowners, renters etc.
